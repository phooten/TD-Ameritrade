# TD-Ameritrade
Dedicated to simplifying processes relating to trading. 

future tools:
	- convert .csv file 
		-> from TDAmeritrade into an ideal format to analyze / replace google options sheet where I currently record the record of my options
	- Display current results:
		-> show the current status / visualization of performance. Probably using QT
		-> probably gets data directly from think or swim
		-> maybe shows strategy currently being used / rules being used
