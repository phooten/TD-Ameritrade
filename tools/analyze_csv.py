# Overview:
#   Goals of this script:
#       - Take in information from from a csv file and output break-even values
#         for a particular stock

# Outline / Plan:
#   - First glance, it might be good to make an object for each ticker that 
#     contains all the information about its purchase price, break even price,
#     how many options were used, average option price, etc. 


# Libraries
import csv
